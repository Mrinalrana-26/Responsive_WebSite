                that there is a higher education system… Teaching What You Don’t Know will find a good audience as a
                rescue manual for the young, as it assuages the anxieties facing the postgraduate or the postdoctoral
                teacher. The book, which clearly draws on a wide range of teaching experience on the U.S. scene, offers
                good advice and outlines some useful strategies. Huston does, moreover, dig up issues that have become
                ever more pressing over the past few years.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">If you teach with technology in any form, at any level, I recommend you
                put this book at the top of your tottering pile of required reading on higher education. It’s an
                outstanding book that provides a road map for truly effective online teaching. What distinguishes
                [Miller’s] book from much of the research available on teaching with technology, and pushes it beyond
                arguments about improving access, is her emphasis on the ways in which online teaching tools can
                actually improve learning for all students—not just those who have no access to traditional face-to-face
                classrooms.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">If you want to read a lively and engaging book on the science of
                learning, this is a must… Make It Stick benefits greatly from its use of stories about people who have
                achieved mastery of complex knowledge and skills. Over the course of the book, the authors weave
                together stories from an array of learners—surgeons, pilots, gardeners, and school and university
                students—to illustrate their arguments about how successful learning takes place… This is a rich and
                resonant book and a pleasurable read that will leave you pondering the processes through which you, and
                your students, acquire new knowledge and skills.</p>
